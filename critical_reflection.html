      The project was an interesting learning opportunity for our group as it enhanced our historical and literary knowledge and polished our technical and digital skills. As a group of three, we created a website to function as a digital catalog of the stories and lives of Enslaved African Muslims in the Americas. The reason we decided to work on this respective topic is that generally, when talking, teaching, or learning about the history, literature, culture, economy, languages, etc., of America, Muslims are generally not seen as part of historical America. Through this work, we aimed to shed light on enslaved Muslims' unique stories, cultural contributions, and resilience in the Americas. We offered a platform to amplify these voices, inspire thoughtful conversations, and highlight that they have been part of and played valuable roles in America throughout history. Furthermore, they are still essential parts of America simultaneously with white Christian or Jewish Americans as they can be seen living the American dream.

The motivation behind this project originated from a desire to explore the intersection of religion, culture, and history in the context of slavery. Enslaved African Muslims faced not only the horrors of enslavement but also the challenge of preserving their faith and cultural identity under oppressive circumstances. These individuals contributed significantly to the cultural and spiritual fabric of the Americas, yet their stories remain underrepresented. We aimed to bridge this gap by presenting a user-friendly, informative platform that educates visitors on these individuals' lives, struggles, and legacies. The project also served as an opportunity to blend historical research with technical creativity. Creating a website could make this knowledge accessible to a global audience, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries. 
<br> <br>

The journey was challenging. The first major hurdle was researching and collecting credible and relevant information sources about enslaved African Muslims. While there is massive scholarship on slavery and enslaved Africans, the available material for specifically enslaved Muslim Africans or just Enslaved Muslims in the Americas is scattered and often requires a depth of research and time. This required extensive research, cross-referencing, and collaboration among team members to ensure accuracy and authenticity. 
<br> <br>

Another challenge was designing the website to be both visually appealing and functional. As a team, we had varying levels of expertise in web development. Coordinating tasks like writing code, designing layouts, and integrating technical features was complex, especially when balancing this with other academic responsibilities. Additionally, ensuring the website was accessible and responsive across different devices added another layer of technical complexity. 
<br> <br>

Despite the challenges, this project was filled with rewarding moments. One of the most fascinating aspects was uncovering personal stories of enslaved African Muslims. For instance, learning about individuals like Omar ibn Said, who wrote an autobiography in Arabic while enslaved in the United States, Nicholas Said, who fought in the Civil War, and Yarrow Mamout, who was known for his financial genius, highlighted the strength of cultural identity, resilience, and intellect amidst adversity. These narratives enriched our understanding and deepened our connection to the project. 
<br> <br>

Collaborating as a team also proved to be a highlight. Each member brought unique skills and perspectives, enhancing the quality of the final product. Sharing ideas and troubleshooting problems together fostered a sense of fellowship and collective ownership of the project.This project has been a transformative learning experience, blending academic inquiry with practical skills. It taught us the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, perseverance in the face of challenges, and the impact of storytelling in fostering empathy and understanding. Most importantly, it underscored the power of technology in amplifying voices from history that deserve to be heard. 
<br> <br>

Looking back, this project is not just a culmination of research and technical effort but a meaningful contribution to preserving the legacy of enslaved African Muslims in the Americas. It is a testament to the enduring power of history to inspire and educate, even in the digital age.
